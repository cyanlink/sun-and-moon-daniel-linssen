# sun-and-moon-daniel-linssen
This is a practice project, fan made Unity port of "sun and moon" by daniel linssen (@managore).

When I lost my creativity I often try to look for some minigame on itch.io. 
You know when some troll arrogant idea-popper comes up with tons of lame, unfeasible, unplayable ideas about making a platformer, things gets
really boring, the team gets unmotivated and whoosh, nothing is achieved in the end.

I would really like to know how Daniel keeps their creativity and constantly coming up with all of these amazing ideas in his portfolio...

I know Daniel Linssen from a forum post of the unity port of another game of his called REAP, 
that project was very helpful for me (at least I learned how to write circle mask shader and recreated one using shader graph).

Today I was checking itch.io again and found this game, it is fun. it is physics based, "simple", but not really. 
I want to create it (the essense of puzzle gameplay) from scratch in Unity.
