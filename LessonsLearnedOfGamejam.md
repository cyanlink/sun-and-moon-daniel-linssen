So it seems every gamejam for a newbie goes like this: 
you might come from a irrelevant education background, or you are a CS student, 
or you are a web developer or backend developer who is confident to say "I know programming", 
then you seek to join a team, thinking to get some experience in gamedev.

Yes I know of course you start yelling and arguing "I went through tutorials! I know the basics of Unity! I know animators, rigs and UI and shader things"

Oh you are so great, then why don't we see what happens next?

First, nobody think they can, or want to carry the team, so they start to imagine, or dream of, 
a big name kind of OG developer exists in the team who can show them the code that implements all sorts of feature stuff, so that they can start learning on it. 
But what are their job in the team anyway? some UI stuff just like web developing? Ehh,
some imaginary peripheral system which is unlikely to exist in a game jam project?

Aaaand, in vast majority of cases, this Deus Machina OG guy never came, we just dream all day wondering how great and amazing our game would be.

Better case? We write tons of design documentations specifying all sorts of features to implement, without implementing any of them, till the end.

Worse case? An arrogant kid takes charge, throwing out tons of gibberish and walking-in-the-sky kind of ideas that are not even wrong, not even able to be implemented.

People with such mindsets including the past me are terribly wrong, we are shameful leeches and hitchhikers who will never ever learn anything or make anything this way.

As a gamedev the correct mindset is exactly the opposite as the "IoC" principle: You don't seek the team, the team should come to you.
